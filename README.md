# Belly Button Biodiversity

An interactive dashboard based on the data collected via the [Belly Button Biodiversity](http://robdunnlab.com/projects/belly-button-biodiversity/) study done by Rob Dunn of NC State University. The dashboard will use a combination of HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript, Plotly, Flask, and Python to allow the user to take a closer look at the data. Broken down by each sample, you can see the differing amounts of bacertia and other components.
